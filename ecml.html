    <h1 id="services">Services</h1>
    <p>ECML services are divided into two categories: <strong>Regional (R)</strong> and <strong>InterCity (IC)</strong>. Currently, there are two services operating on the ECML - one Regional (R) and one InterCity (IC) service.</p>
    <h2>Regional (R)</h2>
    <p><strong>Regional</strong> services make stops at all stations along the line.</p>
    <p>The only Regional service presently operating on the ECML is the <span class="nsw-tag">R21</span> between Harlon Southpoint and West Jaffa.</p>
    <h2>InterCity (IC)</h2>
    <p><strong>InterCity </strong> services only stop at major stations along the line.</p>
    <p>The only InterCity service presently operating on the ECML is the <span class="nsw-tag">IC2</span> between Harlon Southpoint and Victoria North.</p>

        <p><span class="nsw-tag">InterCity</span> <span class="nsw-tag">HarlonTransit</span></p>
        <p>The ECML's northern terminus in the City of Harlon, Harlon Southpoint (known simply as "Southpoint" on the HarlonTransit network) provides a convenient interchange to HarlonTransit's Metro Line M2, which takes passengers further north into the City's core and beyond.</p>

        <p>Directly connected to the Johnson Park Hockey Stadium through covered pedestrian walkways, Johnson Park is a bustling hub on game day, when all HN trains make a stop at this station to transport fans to and from the action. When it's not game day, though, this station is a staple of HN's Regional services, which make regular stops here. Passengers can also change to HarlonTransit Metro Line M5 services a short walk away.</p>

        <p>Seaporte Junction is the last station on the ECML within the City of Harlon's surrounds. As is with most cases, last is certainly not least - passengers can connect to HN's Commuter Rail Network which serves the City and surrounds, as well as HarlonTransit's Metro Line M5, which continues eastward to Seaporte Docks, and north-westward past key destinations such as Times Square, the Great Market Hall and Sergels Square.</p>

        <p>An agricultural town, St. Charles-on-the-Sea has vast agricultural land plots where farmers grow a large portion of Sealand's crops. You can't miss the wheat fields along the line adjacent to the station, a defining feature of this portion of the ECML.</p>

        <p>Rabat Junction will eventually provide a handy interchange to SART services towards Tenan Island and West Jaffa. In any case, it's the first station in the Sealand region along the line that all HN trains call at.</p>

        <p>The terminus of HN InterCity ECML services, Victoria North is a true gemstone in the architectural crown of the City of Victoria. With its grand, imposing arches and columns with a glass roof to top it all off, it's a dramatic and beautiful gateway into the Sealand region's main city. In the future, SART services will stop underground beneath the adjacent coach terminal.</p>

        <p><span class="nsw-tag">Regional</span></p>
        <p>Located on a gorgeous part of Harlon's South Coast, Victoria Observatory is a great place to stop for some fun by the water's edge. With a beach patrolled by lifeguards, a volleyball court and covered seating for those who prefer to be a bit further away from the sun and the water's edge, there's fun in the sun (and the shade) for everyone!</p>

        <p>The southern terminus of the ECML, West Jaffa also marks the westernmost station within the region of Sealand, before the western border with the neighbouring region of Tryon. In the future, SART services from Victoria North and Tenan Island will also terminate here.</p>
